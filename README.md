# Iterative Methods for Approximating Solutions
This project was part of an assignment in the Computational Mathematics module in MSc Data Science. The goal was to write a script which implements the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel Iterative Methods.

The code was, as requested, accompanied by a 2-minute video explaining it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egCMrBU1EMM&feature=youtu.be
